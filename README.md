# How I made it

This project is the first time I work with animation and clip-path on css, I used [this article](https://ishadeed.com/article/clip-path/) to learn more about clip-path property! \
My idea was to add a polygon on top of a background and that polygon increases or decreases size acording to the button which the user is hovering.
